# Domain hierarchy
# ===
#
# The classes below model the same items as the database table above,
# but as a **domain model** — a rich Python class hierarchy.
#
# The database stores all items in one flat table (with a `type` discriminator
# and a `parent_id` foreign key). The domain model expresses the same structure
# using inheritance, where each item kind is its own class with kind-specific fields.
#
# This separation is common in real applications and is known as the
# [object-relational impedance mismatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_impedance_mismatch).

# ===

# This is an example of [inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance).
# Inheritance is a [mechanism in object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming))
# that lets you create a class (child) based on another class (parent)
# and modify some implementation details.
#
# Here, `BaseItem` inherits properties of `BaseModel`,
# a fundamental class in [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/)

# It should be possible to use (objects) of the child class
# where objects of its parent class can so that the properties

# This is called LSP or [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://yakhyo.github.io/solid-python/solid_python/lsp/).

# Here, we inherit from the `BaseItem` class.
# We keep the common fields of the `BaseItem` class such as `id` and `type`.

# We can add different fields in different classes
